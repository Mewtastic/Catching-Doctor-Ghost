# Catching_Doctor_Ghost

## The 5 Rules Are Simple
      Each turn you pick a direction to move in.
      If you land on Dr. Ghost or he can't move, you Win.
      You don't know Dr. Ghost's position until every 4 turns.
      You can only move within the 26*26 grid.
      If you run out of turns, Dr. Ghost Wins.
